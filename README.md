# Best Burger of Austin (BBA)
BBA was a group project at the Iron Yard, where I worked with 2 front end developers and 1 designer in order to create this app over a weekend. My job as the back end developer was to build an API which the front enders could access. It was a great experience where we learned how to manage time and delegate responsibilities to different part of the application. Communication was cruicial in order to make as much progress as possible in a very short amount of time.
